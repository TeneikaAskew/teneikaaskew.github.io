## The Biased Venture Capital System

Women owned businesses are growing 2X faster than all businesses nationwide, and yet, they only receive 2.8% of venture capital (VC) funding. The goal of this project is to help female entrepreneurs understand the VC funding landscape by producing a model to predict success of raising funds while also investigating gender bias and providing recommendations.<br>
